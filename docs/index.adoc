- Template Curriculum -

The international Software Architecture Qualification Board (link:https://isaqb.org[iSAQB]) defines curricula on several levels for software architects.

You can find the Template Level Curriculum (short: TLC) for the foundation level at <<foundation-curriculum.adoc#>>

The terminology used in the iSAQB curricula can be found as a (freely available) ebook, published on https://leanpub.com/isaqbglossary/read[Leanpub]

== Production version

The current productive version (aka: relevant for examinations) is version 4.1 (EN) and 4.2 (DE), both of which are currently only available via the official https://isaqb.org[iSAQB website].

== Development versions
The Foundation Level curriculum is currently maintained and published in both English (EN) and German (DE). Maintainers from the Foundation-Level-Working-Group and voluntary reviewers collaborate on Github to improve the curriculum.
